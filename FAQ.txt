#1.1 - Who made this magnificent HUD?

	- Quartz and Sir Villeta did. Sir Villeta took care of most of the design choices as well as LOGO, Fonts and Class icons used while Quartz
	would take care of all the coding as well as bringing the HUD making experience to the game. Together it resulted in some enjoyable
	moments of chatter,inspiration and just general derpiness :)


#1.2 - How much time did it take to do this?

	- It took more or less 2 months of work with some breaks in between for exams and what not.


#1.3 - Can you add/change X or Y on the HUD?

	- Maybe or maybe not. It really depends on the usefulness and on the way you ask it (politely would be really cool). It's not supposed to
	be a personal HUD but not a strict one either. We'll try to include as many customization options as possible while keeping the general
	HUD design in mind.



#2. » Frequently Asked Customization Questions
##############################################

#2.1 - You said there are crosshairs. How do I enable them?

	#2.1.1 - Normal Crosshairs

		- Open '/scripts/hudlayout.res' and look for 'Quartz Crosshairs' or 'Garm3n Crosshairs'. Next choose the crosshair you're interested
		on and then just change the setting "visible" to "1" instead of "0". When starting your game (or just typing hud_reloadscheme on console)
		the crosshair should now be visible in the middle of your screen. If not you may need to also adjust the "xpos", "ypos", "wide" and "tall"
		properties of the crosshair in order to make it perfectly centered for your screen. Playing with the values, saving the file and
		"hud_reloadscheme" on the console should be easier to try than for me to explain it. :)

	#2.1.2 - Pulsing Crosshairs

		- Same instructions as Normal Crosshairs except the file you need to open now is located in '/resource/ui/HudPlayerHealth.res'.


#2.2 - Will there be more crosshairs?

	- Yes there will. I'll probably include fog's crosshair pack as well as make some crosshairs myself ;)



#2.3 - In the 6v6 Scoreboard I can't see the pings of the players. What to do?
'
	- I've included a custom Scoreboard file inside '/resource/ui'. Just look for the file 'Scoreboard - 4;3.res', rename it to 'Scoreboard.res'
	and replace the old one.
	Note: Only do this if you really can't see the pings :)


#2.4 - In MvM I still se white background at top. What I do?
    
	- I still haven't fixed it, but you can do it yourself hiding the bar also in warm-up: Open WaveStatusPanel.res in resource\ui\ and change
        visible of "Background" from 1 to 0.
