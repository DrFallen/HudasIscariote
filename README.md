# HudasIscariote
Official Release of Hudas Iscariote HUD for Team Fortress 2

//Commonly Asked Questions

Q. Who made this magnificent HUD?<p>
A. The original developers Quartz and Sir Villeta did. Sir Villeta took care of most of the design choices as well as LOGO, Fonts and Class icons used while Quartz would take care of all the coding as well as bringing the HUD making experience to the game.

Since the SteamPipe update it has since been updated by Reddot and Dr.Fallen and has been well supported by community members along they way. Kinevo Network now maintains and hosts the project to this day.

Q. Can you add/change X or Y on the HUD?<p>
A. Possibly. We're look into changes that are most needed in order for the HUD to work in the first place first and then we can look into what can be added. You are always welcome to ask in the discussion board for things that you would like added or have tried to add and we welcome any addons you've made that you feel would make the HUD better and we could even add them to the offical release as extras.

Q. How do I install Hudas?<p>
A. Extract the folder and copy or move the files inside to your Team Fortress 2 custom folder. You will only need the "materials", "resource", "scripts" and sound folders. The extra folder is for adding anything we feel might make your experience better. Open a thread if you have any issues installing.

Q. Is this HUD customisable? What do you recommend adding?
A. Absolutely and we encourage it . You'll need to decide for yourself what you want to add or remove from the HUD (Your the one using it right?). So I can't recommend certain things other another it's all down to your unique playstyle.

//Useful Console Commands

hud_combattext_batching<p>
Setting it to 1 will combine the total dmg you have dealt to a player instead of just the single damage you have done. If you damage multiple people at the same time it show the individual stacked damage done to each person. Useful if you don't like seeing a trail of 6s or 15s going across the screen.

cl_hud_minmode<p>
Setting it to 1 will make the elements like the scoreboard smaller by stacking them on top of each other. If you prefer the vanilla experience of TF2 I would recommend changing this to 0. You can always check what it is currently set to by typing cl_hud_minmode without a number to see if it is 0 or 1.
