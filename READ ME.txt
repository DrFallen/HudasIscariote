	#Description#
	
	- High contrast HUD made to be minimalistic and visually appealing at the same time. Classy looking!



	#Features#

	- They say a Screenshot is worth a thousand words so you might as well check them first :)
	=====
	- Included modified SourceScheme with a smaller font for net_graph users;
	- Included customized Close Captions (activated with "closecaption 1" in console);
	- Both normal and pulsing crosshairs available (for more info check the FAQ);
	- Smaller hit indicators!



	#INSTALLATION#

	- You have 2 options. You can either just copy the folder 'HUDASIscariote' to 'Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom'
	or you create a new folder in that exact location with whichever name you want (eg. HUDs) and copy the contents inside "HUDASIscariote' in there.
